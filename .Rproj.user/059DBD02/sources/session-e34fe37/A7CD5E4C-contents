<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a Master's student in Molecular Medicine at Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, passionate about understanding the interplay between cancer and the immune system.

During my first research rotation at Charité, I investigated tumor--immune interactions in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, combining RNA-seq analysis, immune profiling, and digital pathology. This project sparked my interest in how bioinformatics and image analysis can be integrated to uncover mechanisms of tumor progression and responses to immunotherapy.

Previously, I explored cancer cachexia through transcriptomic datasets, including TCGA and GEO, identifying key molecular signatures involved in inflammation and muscle wasting. This experience strengthened my skills in large-scale data analysis and deepened my interest in the molecular mechanisms driving cancer-associated syndromes.

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of immuno-oncology, computational biology, and translational research - and how integrative approaches can support both discovery and clinical application. I have also worked in clinical trials in oncology and neurology, and was awarded the Bayer Foundation Carl Duisberg Fellowship for Medical Sciences.

Outside the lab, you'll probably find me exploring Berlin's cultural corners or designing visual narratives from messy datasets.
