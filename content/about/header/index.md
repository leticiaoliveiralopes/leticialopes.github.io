<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a Master's student in Molecular Medicine at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, with a strong interest in the intersection of systems biology, computational methods, and cancer research. I'm particularly fascinated by how omics-driven approaches can help unravel the complexity of tumor--immune dynamics and guide translational discovery.

During my first research rotation at Charité, I investigated tumor--immune interactions in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, combining RNA-seq analysis, immune profiling, and digital pathology. This project sparked my passion for integrating bioinformatics and image analysis to understand mechanisms of tumor progression and responses to immunotherapy.

Previously, I explored cancer cachexia using transcriptomic datasets, including TCGA and GEO, identifying key molecular signatures involved in inflammation and muscle wasting. This experience strengthened my skills in large-scale data analysis and deepened my interest in the molecular underpinnings of cancer-associated syndromes.

I'm particularly interested in the convergence of immuno-oncology, computational biology, and translational research - and how integrative, multi-modal strategies can support both discovery and clinical application. I also gained industry experience working in clinical trials across oncology and neurology, and was awarded the Bayer Foundation Carl Duisberg Fellowship for Medical Sciences.

Outside the lab, you'll likely find me exploring a new café in Berlin, watching football, or turning complex data into visual stories.
