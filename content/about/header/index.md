<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a Master's student in Molecular Medicine at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, with a strong interest in the intersection of systems biology, computational methods, and cancer research. I'm particularly fascinated by how omics-driven approaches can help unravel the complexity of tumor--immune dynamics and guide translational discovery.

During my first research rotation at Charité, I investigated tumor--immune interactions in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, combining RNA-seq analysis, immune profiling, and digital pathology. This project sparked my passion for integrating bioinformatics and image analysis to understand mechanisms of tumor progression and responses to immunotherapy.

Since my undergraduate studies, I have worked with bulk transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO, focusing on tumor-immune interactions in the context of cancer cachexia and microRNA-mediated regulation. Over time, I have developed a growing interest in how transcriptomic and epigenetic layers intersect in shaping the tumor microenvironment. This has motivated me to pursue a more integrated view of gene regulation across different molecular layers.

I'm particularly interested in the convergence of immuno-oncology, computational biology, and translational research, and how integrative, multi-modal strategies can support both discovery and clinical application. I also gained industry experience working in clinical trials across oncology and neurology.

Outside the lab, you'll likely find me exploring a new café in Berlin, watching football, or turning complex data into visual stories.
