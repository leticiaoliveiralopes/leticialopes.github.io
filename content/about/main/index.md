I'm passionate about understanding the interplay between cancer and the immune system.  
Currently, I explore tumor--immune interactions in cSCC using RNA-seq, immune profiling, and digital pathology. Previously, I worked on cancer cachexia and large-scale transcriptomic analysis using TCGA/GEO.  
I'm interested in how computational biology and translational research intersect.
