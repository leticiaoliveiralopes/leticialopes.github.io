## Summary
This projects explore the role of microRNAs in muscle atrophy, combining transcriptomic analysis and in vitro validation. We investigated how miR-155-5p and miR-497-5p influence muscle cell differentiation and inflammatory pathways in skeletal muscle disorders.
The studies were conducted using C2C12 cell lines and data integration from public transcriptomic datasets. Molecular targets were identified through differential expression analysis and validated by qPCR, Western blot, and functional assays.

## Focus Areas
miR-155-5p and myotube differentiation: Functional assays demonstrated the role of miR-155-5p in inhibiting myogenesis, revealing target genes involved in immune response and muscle development.
miR-497-5p and IL-6-induced atrophy: We showed that decreased miR-497-5p expression contributes to inflammatory muscle wasting, identifying key transcripts regulated by this microRNA in the context of IL-6 signaling.
Integration of transcriptome and microRNAome: Combining bulk RNA-seq and miRNA expression data allowed us to construct regulatory networks linking inflammation, muscle degeneration, and microRNA control.
