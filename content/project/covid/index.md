## Summary
This project investigates the role of anti-AGTR1 autoantibodies in the progression and accumulation of COVID-19 symptoms. We combined multi-omics, clinical data, and network-based approaches to understand how persistent immune dysregulation may contribute to long COVID phenotypes.
The analysis revealed that elevated anti-AGTR1 levels were associated with an increased number of reported symptoms across individuals. These findings suggest a potential autoimmune component to COVID-19 symptom persistence and highlight new biomarkers for future investigation.

## Focus Areas
Autoantibody profiling: Detection of dysregulated anti-AGTR1 autoantibodies using ELISA and integrative transcriptomic analysis.
Systems-level analysis: Integration of transcriptome, symptom count, and immunological data to uncover patterns of dysregulation.
Clinical relevance: Findings suggest a role for anti-AGTR1 in immune-mediated tissue damage and offer potential for biomarker discovery in post-acute COVID-19 syndromes.
