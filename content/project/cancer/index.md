## Summary
This project brings together different aspects of cancer research, from systemic effects such as cancer-associated cachexia to the tumorâ€“immune interface in immunotherapy in cancer. Using transcriptomic analysis, digital pathology, and immune profiling, we aim to better understand how inflammation, microRNAs, and immune evasion contribute to cancer progression.
The research spans both public data integration (e.g. TCGA, GEO) and in-house experimental pipelines combining RNA-seq and image-based tissue analysis. These complementary approaches provide insights into the molecular and immune landscapes of cancer.

Focus Areas
Cancer cachexia: Analysis of transcriptomic datasets and functional experiments revealed that miR-497-5p modulates IL-6-induced muscle wasting.
Immune evasion and cSCC: Ongoing project investigating immune infiltration and transcriptomic signatures in cSCC using digital pathology and bulk RNA-seq.
Multi-modal data integration: Combining clinical data, gene expression, immune markers, and histological features to develop composite immune classifications.
